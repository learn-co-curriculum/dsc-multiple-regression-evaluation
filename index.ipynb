    "\n",
    "Multiple regression models, like simple regression models, can be evaluated using R-Squared (coefficient of determination) for measuring the amount of explained variance, and the F-statistic for determining statistical significance. You also may want to consider using other metrics, including adjusted R-Squared and error-based metrics such as MAE and RMSE. Each metric provides slightly different information, so you will need additional information from stakeholders in order to choose the most appropriate one(s)."

    "\n",
    "First, as we add more predictors, R-Squared is only going to increase. More predictors allow the model an extra degree of freedom in trying to approximate a target. But this doesn't necessarily mean we have a better model, since we're likely to start seeing coefficients that are unstable and potentially not statistically significant. (We'll also see that these models might violate some of the _assumptions_ of linear regression, which we'll describe in more detail later.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, consider using **adjusted R-Squared**. This version of R-Squared includes a correction for the number of predictors used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, \"proportion of variance explained\" may not be the best way to describe your model's performance. It is very sensitive to the variance in the available data, where a very small variance in the predictors can lead to a small R-Squared and a very large variance in the predictors can lead to a large R-Squared, regardless of how well the model actually describes the true relationship between the variables. It can also be challenging to use when communicating with non-technical stakeholders who are less likely to have an understanding of \"variance\".\n",
